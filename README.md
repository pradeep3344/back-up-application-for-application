# back-up-application-for-application


An automatic backup system is a system that allows for the recovery of information stored on computers.
Automatic backups are necessary in order to back up stored data and to enable data recovery should the system crash. 
By automating a backup through a regular backup system, the user doesn't have to protect data manually.
A successful automatic backup system will be immune to situations that could occur at the hard drives' physical location, such as fire, 
floods and other natural disasters. This is why automatic backup systems should be remote, and data restoration and retrieval should be 
located away from the original data storage location. Automation is basically
making a hardware or software that is capable of doing things automatically without human intervention
